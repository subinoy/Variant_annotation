## Variant Analysis Pipeline
This repository contains a fully automated pipeline for variant analysis, designed to process and analyze genomic data from raw FASTQ files through to annotated variant calls. It supports various types of genomic variations, including SNVs, CNVs, and structural variants, and is highly customizable to fit different research needs.

**Overview**

The Variant Analysis Pipeline is designed to perform:

Quality control on raw sequencing data

Mapping and alignment to reference genomes

Variant calling for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs),
and structural variants (SVs)

Variant annotation using popular databases for functional insights

This pipeline is built with reproducibility in mind, supporting containerized execution through Docker and Conda environments.

### Pipeline Workflow

**Preprocessing**

**Quality Control:** Uses FastQC to assess read quality and Trimmomatic for adapter trimming.
		
**Alignment**

**Mapping:** Align reads to a reference genome with BWA or Bowtie2.
**Post-alignment processing:** Sort and index BAM files, and mark duplicates with samtools or Picard.
		
**Variant Calling**

**SNVs:** Called using GATK HaplotypeCaller.
**CNVs:** Detected using cnvkit or Control-FREEC.
**Structural Variants:** Identified using Lumpy, Manta, or DELLY.

**Annotation**

**Variant Annotation:** Annotates variants with ANNOVAR or VEP to identify functional effects and disease relevance.
		
**Quality Control and Reporting**

Generates reports on variant quality and summarizes findings.
